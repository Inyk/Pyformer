# Pyformer

A 2D platformer created with Pygame and Python. The goal of this project is to simply help me learn Python better doing something I enjoy, making games.

# What is this game?

I am very much designing this as I go, however, the general idea is that I want to create a 2D platformer that incorporates physics
to a certain degree.

# Todo list 

Add left and right movement

Add jump and gravity

Replace placeholder player image with an animated sprite

Add floor, solid platforms, and fix player starting location


# Build the game

The game isn't anywhere close to being finished but if you want to check on my progress at any time just download the file and run
main.py
